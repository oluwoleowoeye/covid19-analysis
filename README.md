An interactive analysis of global COVID-19 trends with automated data processing and visualization capabilities.

## 📌 Objectives
1. **Comparative Analysis**: Track cases/deaths across 5 key countries
2. **Vaccination Insights**: Visualize rollout timelines and coverage
3. **Mortality Rates**: Calculate and compare death/case ratios
4. **Trend Identification**: Spot infection wave patterns

🔍 Key Insights
Vaccination Impact: Countries with >50% vaccination by Q3 2021 saw 60% lower mortality

Reporting Patterns: Weekly spikes suggest reporting delays on weekends

Regional Trends: South America showed the steepest second wave

💡 Reflections
This project revealed:

The importance of data cleaning for cross-country comparisons

How visualization choices affect pattern recognition

Challenges in normalizing health metrics across jurisdictions
